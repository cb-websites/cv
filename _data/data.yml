It then accesses, via REST,  the client's Veeva (SalesForce) account and, using the information in the previously downloaded file and applying a series of string matching techniques (trying to also avoid eventual typos of the users) it tries to determine if the new users are already registered. For the users found to already be registered in the Veeva system, a series of validation procedures are run, in accordance with rules provided by the client. The resulted records are divided by provenience system and saved to files that are then sent by email. The final result is also recorded to an SQLite database. The precision of the matching procedure is around 70-80% which in this case is very good. The software is installed and runs on a VM instance, on GCP, on Windows 2019 Server.
