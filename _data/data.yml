        link: "#"
        tagline: "Project with Python using the libraries Pandas, simple_salesforce, fuzzywuzzy, selenium, sqlite3, and yagmail. It accesses a proprietary website of the client and downloads an updated report of the new user sign up requests. It then accesses, via REST,  the client's Veeva (SalesForce) account and, using the information in the previously downloaded file and applying a series of string matching techniques (trying to also avoid eventual typos of the users) it tries to determine if the new users are already registered. For the users found to already be registered in the Veeva system, a series of validation procedures are run, in accordance with rules provided by the client. The resulted records are divided by provenience system and saved to files that are then sent by email. The final result is also recorded to an SQLite database. The precision of the matching procedure is around 70-80% which in this case is very good. The software is installed and runs on a VM instance, on GCP, on Windows 2019 Server. Developed for a large pharmaceutical company"

Given that the variables in this world are ever changing (medics move away, reps resign, etc.) the company finds it hard to keep track and always have a clear image of what is going on with their sales force. I helped develop and implement an application that extracts information from the client's information systems (via REST API) and updates the assignment of the reps to their respective territories.
